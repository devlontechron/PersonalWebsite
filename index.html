			<h3>"So, what are your plans after school?"</h3>
			<p>I graduate in June of 2017 with a Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science & Systems from the University of Washington (Tacoma Campus)! I am honored and very lucky in that I’ll be doing research work this summer at the university on Uni-Kernel Operating System in the Cloud. I’ll also be taking a Networking class this summer on top of the research work so I’ll be inside a lot. I’m still on the hunt for a job (because I bought myself time) and will hopefully have something lined up by late August. I also anticipate moving to downtown Seattle (as I know many are excited about) no later than September. As for the more distant future, I’m not 100% sure yet. I do plan on returning to school for my masters, but I’m not sure what in. I don’t plan on staying in Seattle for too long and have been toying with moving to somewhere warmer and bigger.
