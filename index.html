			<h3>Looking For Work!</h3>
			<p>This is just a quick small side project to set up my personal server. I’m doing this to hopefully later migrate the data for this website over and have everything stored there. I also need a personal and safe place to store things that’s under my control and that I manage. The hardware I'll be using is my old Lenovo laptop with 4gb of ram and over about 500Gb of storage. As for the software, I will be getting more hands on time with Linux based OS and I will be installing Ubuntu Desktop for lighter, faster, and easier processing. </p>

			<h3>Website</h3>
			<p>Started working on the website in the latter half of the summer of 2016. I think I officially launched somewhere in mid-September with only one static page that simply said “hello world”. From there I have developed, from scratch using HTML5, JS, and CSS3, this work in progress personal website. I taught myself the language and how to launch using github and Codecademy. This has personally been my favorite project to work on. Much of the work has been me just struggling / fighting with CSS and trying to get everything just right. I will forever come back to this and update it and continue to work on it over the coming years. My end dream is for this to become a very slick, feature rich, smooth website that incorporate angular and other cutting edge languages. I hope for this to be a one stop destination for employers, researchers, friends and family to discover and explore who I am, what I’ve done, what I’m going to do, and where I’m heading.  </p>

			<h3>UpdateLog</h3>
			<p> .
			<br> <br>I had a lot of fun with this project simply because it was a reality check for me in the sense that I realized who I was in the project and how much I knew. It was a wonderful taste of the career field and government work. Healthcare is also something I’m very interested in so it was that much more engaging for me. I also had to cram a lot of information and do a lot of personal research work so I could explain it and present it properly to the health department board.  </p>
