			<h3>Website</h3>
			<p>Started working on the website in the latter half of the summer of 2016. I think I officially launched somewhere in mid-September with only one static page that simply said “hello world”. From there I have developed, from scratch using HTML5, JS, and CSS3, this work in progress personal website. I taught myself the language and how to launch using github and Codecademy. This has personally been my favorite project to work on. Much of the work has been me just struggling / fighting with CSS and trying to get everything just right. I will forever come back to this and update it and continue to work on it over the coming years. My end dream is for this to become a very slick, feature rich, smooth website that incorporate angular and other cutting edge languages. I hope for this to be a one stop destination for employers, researchers, friends and family to discover and explore who I am, what I’ve done, what I’m going to do, and where I’m heading.  </p>
