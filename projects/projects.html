				<h3>E-Ink Picture Frame</h3>
				<p>Home made digital picture frame project using an raspberry-pi and and E-Ink digital screen, I wanted to develop something where i could see and potentially share my digital photos but not be bothered by yet another glowing screen. E-ink perfectly fits this use case and required me to to do some real low level (C++) coding. Written in python, C++, and calling public API's such as Wikipedia PotD, and my own Google Photos, I was able to develop a working prototype that provides a new image every day. Many expansions are planned for this project including sharing, and widgets.</p>

				<h3>Website</h3>
				<p>I Started working on the website in the latter half of the summer of 2016. I think I officially launched somewhere in mid-September with only one static page that simply said "hello world". From there I have developed, from scratch using HTML5, JS, and CSS3, this work in progress personal website. I taught myself the language and how to launch using github and Codecademy. This has personally been my favorite project to work on. Much of the work has been me just struggling / fighting with CSS and trying to get everything just right. I will forever come back to this and update it and continue to work on it over the coming years. My end dream is for this to become a very slick, feature rich, smooth website that incorporate angular and other cutting edge languages. I hope for this to be a one stop destination for employers, researchers, friends and family to discover and explore who I am, what I've done, what I'm going to do, and where I'm heading.  </p>
				<p>UPDATE March 2019: Complete redesign of the website was done to refresh look and feel along with general information. The UX / UI was also redesigned for a more original style where everything "circles" around different topics. The site also uses newer web technologies to allow for a responsive design.  </p>
				<p>UPDATE April 2020: Completed redesign using accordion views for more modern look and feel while focusing on touch first design. Also included responsive web design for multiple screen sizes</p>

				<h3>MIT COVID19 Hackathon</h3>
				<img src="../resources/PoolQ.jpg"></a>
				<p>Participated in a weekend long hackathon put on by MIT to solve the global pandemic that is COVID19. Paired up with a team of data scientists, health professionals, and other SDEs, we developed a proof of concept web application to load balance and distribute testing while intelligently ranking and identifying high risk or heat maps of infected patients. With this, we were able to provide large scale testing by group patients from multiple organizations and regions to batch test and identify hot spots. Used technologies such as AWS Beanstalk, Springboot, and mySql. http://mitcovid-env.eba-kp5pu7vi.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/ </p>
				<p>This event re-invigorated my passion for coding and allowed me to demonstrate and prove to myself how much I have learned and grown as a Software Developer in industry, in the last 2 years. From concept to *near* completion, I lead the design and technology use cases to develop a fully, ready to launch, globally scalable web application while consuming data driven metrics and information.</p>

			<h3>Holidaze</h3>
			<img src="../resources/holidazeSS.jpg"></a>
			<p>From concept to completion, I smashed through 2 weeks to produce this quick and fun web application to track users and phrases for a family drinking game. Users log in with names and can add new phrases while scoring points by selecting what phrases or events have happened. I build 3 different Azure functions (GET login/validate, GET data, POST Phrases) along with a dynamic web application UI with a mobile first design. This project really proved to myself how quickly I’m able to pick up new tools and apply them when needed while also expanding on my skill set in the new era of cloud development. This also allowed me to compare and contrast Azure with AWS and I have to say I was very impressed with Azure’s ease of use. I would like to come back to this project and replicated it but using AWS Lambda functions. That being said, I do believe that these small cloud functions are the future of software development. I also wrote my functions in Python3, the third project I have chosen to use Python, which has solidified my opinions on the flexible, non-type casting, high level language: Python is great for data scientists and engineers who need a quick little function to run and process data at a local or non-production level environment. Beyond this, this project also reinvigorated my love for coding and demonstrated my passion to leverage my skills to help and build something for others.</p>

            <h3>OpenRCT2</h3>
            <p>Actively engaged and committing to an open source community focused around 2002 PC game "Roller Coaster Tycoon 2" by Chris Sawyer. Written in base C, this small but very active coding community supports frequent updates with bug fixes, new features such as online and touch interfaces, and porting code to other platforms such as Android or iOS. <a href="https://openrct2.org/" target="_blank" >OpenRCT2</a> challenges me to uphold coding standards, communicating with others, code documentation and testing, and much more.  </p>

            <h3>Budget Parser</h3>
            <p>This was a quick, fun, python based project to complete two things: First, I wanted to get a good understanding of python and its syntax to build up the language skill. This project really showed me how quick python is to use and develop in but also revealed how annoying non-type casting programming can be. The second part of this project was an idea I've always had of being able to have persistent data without the use of a database server. The workaround for this was to use a local JSON file to update tagging and categorizing information which would be built up over time. This provided a perfect solution for quick, easy access to data that would could be called on in the future and by others, so long as they have the file, without the need of a server.</p>

			<h3>[Research] OSv Unikernel 2017</h3>
			 <a href="../resources/OSvThesis-compressed.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="../resources/osvThumb.PNG"></a>
			<p>I'm very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Dr. Wes Lloyd under the University of Washington on Uni-Kernel and OSv software deployed on the cloud. We measured the efficiency and cost of implementing a Kernel level application to a server using Amazon Web Services. This application approach is a brand-new type of software that lets an application act and work on the Kernel level. The idea is to let the application request and build the most bare-bones operating system and stand alone. This reduced boot times and increases efficiencies in time and space. OSv and Uni-Kernel have already been implemented and have shown their value in other areas of the industry. However, we examined the comparative cost difference between web services and how it impacted the application. </p>

			<h3>The Mask</h3>
			<p>I took an "object art" class in my senior year of college and was given the task to create something that represented "emotion". Being the only CS major in the class, I wanted to showcase computers ability that can extend even into the arts. I 3D printed a mask which housed a microphone and raspberry pi device along with LEDs around the edge. Using python and Google AI APIs, I developed a system that given key words and phrases, the mask would change colors. This piece actually now hangs in my home near my smart speaker home device</p>

			<h3>Hackalong</h3>
			<img src="../resources/hackAlong.png"></a>
			<p>An android based application that allows users to browse, search, and follow hackathons happening nearby or around the country. Providing information like dates, times, themes, attendees and more. Users have profiles with "attributes" to suggest hackathons and people with similar interests to connect and collaborate. Developed using Android Studio, my small three person group was able to build and deploy this app using public APIs, firebase database, and php backends. </p>

			<h3>Personal Server</h3>
			<p>This was a quick side project to set up my personal server to host my website along with other media files. The hardware I'm using is an older HP tower with 4gb of ram and about 500Gb of storage running Ubuntu 18.04.1 server. </p>

			<h3>Pierce County Health Department</h3>
			<p>Worked in a small team of 4 as a technical consultant for Pierce County Health Department in which I developed a database and software support concepts by collecting data from professionals in the health industry and from other US state who have implemented a similar system. The health department was looking to incorporate a system that would allow individual health care workers to be able to work freely with civilians but also be able to bridge those individuals to hospitals and other healthcare organizations or resources. The database was to include: a log of all the healthcare workers in the county with what skills or certifications they had, healthcare organizations and what they could treat or do for specific patients along with keeping and tracking an individual's health records, and link the system with other local organizations and their resources and events for community members to sign up for or be notified of.  This was the big idea and final dream of the department. I worked on a smaller scale in a way that we only focused on applying the system to just the city of Tacoma. I collected and research data on every key piece or data point that should be collected, how to merge other databases from other organizations, the hardware and software cost, software support, IT support, customer support, actual data structure of the database, alternative options, how to be prepared to scale properly for expansion, and a three-month deployment plan.
			</p>
			<p>I had a lot of fun with this project simply because it was a reality check for me in the sense that I realized who I was in the project and how much I knew. It was a wonderful taste of the career field and government work. Healthcare is also something I'm very interested in so it was that much more engaging for me. I also had to cram a lot of information and do a lot of personal research work so I could explain it and present it properly to the health department board.  </p>
