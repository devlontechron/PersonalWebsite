Was it terrifying?
That you got up today. 
That you now have to endure yet another agonizing day.
Knowing that this wasn't what you wanted to become but, hey, here you are, doing the same thing from yesterday. 
Are you tired form work? or tired from the repetition?
Are you scared that nothing will surprising you ever again?
Are you concerned that this is what life is really all about in the end?
Maybe you got sold the wrong dream, or were told the worst lie.
I'm scared I'm going to wake up one day and be just like you.
I tell myself I'm different, that I won't fall into the rut, but how can I be sure?
Are your really happy or have you bought into it?
Is it easy to see where you'll be in 20 years?
How many times have you toyed with taking a left rather than a right?
You work every day till your exhausted to be able to come home and be exhausted.
You live every day like this is the only option and don't dare question any other.
You breath everyday just like the last. Like there is nothing to hold your breath over. 
Is this everything you wanted to be?
What happened to your dreams? Ideas? Wants? Motivation? Drive? Demand? Aspirations? Excitement? Questions? Curiosity? Perspective? What happened to the person that has decided to put themselves in a box and be comfortable with living every day begging for it to end.  Going to sleep each night hoping the next day wouldn't start. A nightmare to you would be an adventure to anyone. And youâ€¦you could have been someone. Yet you take the exact same steps every day.
Your feet are tired not because you have gone somewhere, but because they are bored. Your eyes grow weary not because they are overwhelmed by beauty, but because they can't stand seeing the same thing. Your ears grow deaf not because you've heard everything but because anything new might startle you. 
There is a massive world beyond your scope and just out of reach.
What are you scared of?
What are you concerned about? 
What are you tired from?
What did you want to get out of life? 
Well hey, this is what you got. The same thing as yesterday.
So you got up today.  But What else did you do? Who else did you meet? Which adventure did you take? What difference did you make?  
Was it terrifying?
