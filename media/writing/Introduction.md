So what do I say? Im not sure on how to do this.
To write words in an artistic way.
 
I want to make a good impression. But it’s not really my profession. 
 
Im so scared to put myself out there. I might screw up or run out of air.
 
What if I don’t follow the rhyming scheme? I might stop,  forget, sit here and … yell

These are simple words. I need to use more better verbs.
 
Can a computer scientist not be socially inept? To be funny, interesting, and not be socially sidestepped? 
 
I want to express myself. get my thoughts out and Not be kept on some shelf. 
 
Perhaps I am getting the hang of this. Who cares if this is good, bad or generally piss.
 
Remember that this isn’t for you. The words artistic and narcissistic are often confused.
 
See that wit. The main difference. I look for quality, not quantity, the rest is interference.

To my vanity, arrogance, demeanor…oh god I was made for the arts. 
 
Hopefully my lexicon skills will improve so I can finally get some social affirmation and dad might actually approve. 
 
It’s beginning to look like I do know what to do. Write down a few words here, make a couple of rhymes there. perhaps Im becoming too self-aware.
 
Well now that this informative monolog has been bookended per-say, I guess I should answer my first question with the simple 
“hey”
