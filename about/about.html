                    Organically raised and grass fed in Portland Oregon, I grew up with my older brother and mother in a modest home. I attended public school in the Clackamas county school district up till high school where I then transferred to La Salle Catholic College Preparatory. There, after struggling with culture shock, I became invested in theater, art, and the science department. I learned to adapt, work hard, and challenge my peers the same way they challenged me. I graduated with honors in 2013 and moved north to attend University of Washington. The 4+ blurred years of late nights at the library and intoxicating weekends with friends further developed my view of the world while still expanding on them. I was exposed as to what the world had to offer and discovered what I wanted. I graduated in the summer of 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science and would move on to my first "big-boy" job as a software developer in 2018 near Seattle. Here I developed large scale applications for managing user data traffic a nation-wide network, directly impacting users and the company. After completing this task and taking the software to production, I then purchased a one-way ticket to Europe toto take a month-long sabbatical and go solo backpacking through London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Zurich, and Rome. There I met people and saw things I had only ever heard or read about, realizing that humans are capable of anything. Upon returning to Seattle, I would attempt to re-apply to school only to have a once in a lifetime pandemic detour my options but also provide a chance for a recruiter at Microsoft, my dream job, ask if I were interested in an interview. My first day at Microsoft would be later that April.

                    As previously stated, I have been working in industry for a little over two years post undergraduate. I have learned several things about myself and others. From enterprise coding standards like security, design, and testing, to working with my colleagues, managers, and business focused individuals, I have found value in the ability to put the last few years of theory from school into real world practice.

                    Beyond career, I have also been able to explore my personal interests outside of career. Thanks to the lack of homework, papers, and research, I have learned to go out and discover the world around me and myself in it. Things such as backpacking across Europe, film and art and their current impacts on society, food and my inability to cook, along with sports like rugby, skiing, and running. I continue to read fiction such as Bradbury, Fitzgerald, and Serling while remaining sharp with academic papers and books alike. My affection for coding has revealed itself to me in the number of coding projects and open source communities that I participate in weekly.

                    The last few years have been a lot of introspection which has only solidified my morals, ethics, and perspective while guiding me towards my future. I strive towards a version of myself that is simply better than the one yesterday while promoting others to do the same. I aim to disrupt the current standard of our world, question the status quo and authority, while exploring the unknown to discovery something new about the world and ourselves.

                    I currently have my sights set on returning to academics in the pursuit of bleeding edge research such as quantum computing. In the same avenue, I look to help others explore new topics and concepts relating to computers by focusing on education and communication. While the private sector has been generous to me, I find myself wanting more and long for a setting that will challenge me daily. I yearn to grow myself and others in a way that would propagate outward and onwards to those who are willing to listen and push for the same. Because once we collectively start talking about our ambitions, our faults, and our ideas, that’s when we begin to empower each other and that’s how we change the world.
