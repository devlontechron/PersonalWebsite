                    Organically raised and grass fed in Portland Oregon, I grew up with my older brother and mother in a modest home. I attended public school in the Clackamas county school district up till high school where I then transferred to La Salle Catholic College Preparatory. There, after struggling with culture shock, I became invested in theater, art, and the science department. I learned to adapt, work hard, and challenge my peers the same way they challenged me. I graduated with honors in 2013 and moved north to attend University of Washington. The next four blurred years of late nights at the library and intoxicating weekends with friends, further developed my view of the world while still expanding on them. I graduated in the summer of 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science and would move on to my first "big-boy" job as a software developer in 2018 near Seattle. Here I developed large scale application that managed traffic on a nation-wide network, directly impacting users and the company. I then purchased a one-way ticket to Europe and went backpacking through London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Zurich, and Rome. There I met people and saw things I had only ever heard or read about, realizing that humans are capable of anything and that we are all out here just trying our best. Upon returning to Seattle, I would attempt to re-apply to school only to have a once in a lifetime pandemic detour my options. This would also provide a chance for a recruiter at Microsoft, my dream job, to contact me and ask if I were interested in an interview. My first day at Microsoft would be April 2020 and I would go on to work there for about 5 years learning the ins and outs of enterprise software on a scale like none other. In the Summer of 2024, I looked at my partner and asked what he thought about moving across the country to my dream city, New York, NY. I the heat of July, with a truck filled with all my belongings, we drove 2,851 miles across the country in about 68 hours. My home office windows now looks out towards the East River.

                    Currently living in New York, I've set out on, yet again, redefining my path and life. The last 10 years in industry has somewhat soured my perspective on Tech and its positive impact on society while also forcing me to wrestle with questions about what I want out of life. Education and Art as a way of helping others to think has always been a center piece for me. An appreciation for health and fitness has helped me 'get out of bed in the morning' to be thankful for what I have now and how I got here. Living in the greatest city in the world also makes it hard to squander the day away.

                    I can only blame Mike, my local barber, here in the East Village, who asked my on my first visit and first week in New York, *"So whats your Flex? If you could 'Flex' on anything about you, what would it be?"*. I told him thats a great question and wanted to think it over. I sat there in silence when Mike finished my haircut and as I got up to pay and leave I told him my answer: *"My 'Flex' is, I got everything I ever wanted, dreamed of, and hoped for in my life. All before the age of 30."* Mike: "Oh. Oh *Wow.*".

                <p>
                    I have embarked on a new chapter in life; The last few years have been a lot of introspection which has only solidified my morals, ethics, and perspective while guiding me towards my future. I have fallen into a life I would have never expected thanks to the love and support of my partner Jon, my friends, my family, my teachers and classmates, my coworkers, and the random barber named Mike. I have no idea where life goes next, but today, I strive towards a version of myself that is simply better than the one yesterday. I aim to disrupt the current standard of our world, question authority and the status quo, while exploring the unknown to discovery something new about the world and myself.

                    Because I believe that once we collectively start talking about our ambitions, our faults, and our ideas, and out dreams, thats when we begin to empower each other and thats how we change the world.
