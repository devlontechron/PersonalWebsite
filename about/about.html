                    Organically raised and grass fed in Portland, OR, I grew up with my older brother and single mother in a modest home. I attended public school in the Clackamas county school district up till high school where I then started at La Salle Catholic College Preparatory. There, after struggling with culture shock, I became invested in theater, art, and the science department. I learned to adapt, work hard, and challenge my peers the same way they challenged me. I graduated with honors in 2013 and moved north to attend University of Washington. The 4+ blurred years of late nights at the library and intoxicating weekends with friends cemented my morals and pillars in who I am. I was exposed as to what the world had to offer and I discovered what I wanted. I would then graduate in the summer of 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science and would move on to my first "big-boy" job as a software developer in 2018 near Seattle.

                    After graduating college, I moved to downtown Seattle in 2018 and have been experience the art, food, and people while adjusting to city life. Between exploring the vast parks in Seattle to the gritty corners of the cement jungle, I've learned to enjoy the city around me and work on my personal skills by meeting new people and trying new things.

                    The lack of homework, papers, and research, has allowed a me to discover the world around me and myself in it. I have realized my interest in film runs deep with my constant support and activity in the local film community. I support the local film festivals and independent showings at the nearby Seattle theaters. I've also found the time to read more; From favorite writers like Bradbury, Fitzgerald, and Serling, I even gone so far as to start a book club that stretches across the pacific north west with weekly online meetings and discussions.

                    As for my career, I am a software Developer at T-Mobile leading the next revolution of automation and machine learning tools to leverage a rapidly growing networking company in a 5G future. My projects have ranged from developing IoT standards to building a load balancer for a nationwide network. I'm discovering real-world problems while gaining the skills and exposure to solve them.

                    Looking forward, I plan to stay in the tech industry for a little while to gain experience and understanding of real-world problems and solutions. I have found when it comes to my career, what I value most is daily coding and solving large scale problems with high impact.

                    I do intend to return to school to work on a masters in computer science. From there, I would like to work part time as a lecturer or researcher while I then work towards a PhD. My end goal is to lead the field of computer science while teaching and showcasing its power to a new generation of young minds.

                    I hope to travel and see the world to explore and experience the dynamic cultures around us. Our greatest asset is diversity but its one of our biggest hurdles right now. I'll most likely forever call the west coast home but I'm more keen on that warm California life.

            <h2>"Why Do You Wake Up Every Morning?"</h2>
            
            <p>
                    After college, I had trouble identifying who I was and what I believed in. I had to figure out my place in the grand scheme of the universe. What were my values? Where did I come from? Where did I want to go? Who did I want to be? My favorite question to ask people is: "Why do you wake up in the morning?". I like this question because it quickly shows what a person's values are in their life at that time. The answers are dynamic and often change. It's not an easy question, but I'm not here to ask easy questions. I feel like the trouble in the world today is no one is listening to each other. If we would all just take 10 minutes a day and have difficult but respectful conversation to hear each other's perspective, then the world would spin slightly different. I promote others to be the best versions of themselves and expect my peers to do the same. I believe that if we all worked together, supported each other, and pushed everyone to be better, we as a society could do great things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My answer to this question varies day by day and has shifted over the years. But the core sentiment of my answer has remained the same:
