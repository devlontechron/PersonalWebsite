    <h3>Life Story</h3>
    
	<pre>
     Grew up in the beautiful city of Portland Oregon where I attended public schools in the city of Gladstone OR for grades k-8. From a very early age, I was very interested in chemistry and engineering while I cursed biology. I participated in many sports such a soccer, baseball, and football and was also a part of the school’s band playing trombone, tuba, and drums. However, my education was much more important to me and I became a straight A student in my later years in middle school. 
     
     I then was accepted into La Salle Catholic College Preparatory in Milwaukie OR where I received my high school diploma and graduated with academic awards in math and theater along with a few college credits. I was deeply engaged with the theater department taking on many roles such as stage manager, lighting crew member, actor, and more. I began to remove myself from this community as I began working at a retail store. I was able to manage school, friends, work, and homework surprising well. As for my last summer, I took on a second full time job working for the Oregon City Police Department doing many different jobs such as ticketing, metering, enforcing code, painting, filing, and much more. I packed up my car with my belongings, said goodbye, and left for Tacoma Washington.
    
     I narrowly chose to attend Tacoma Community College due to financial reasons and would later relize it would be one of my biggest regrets. However, I pushed forward and spent two years and earned the credits for an associates in computer science. I then quickly transferred over to the University of Washington and was accepted in the institute of technology.  
    
    So with that, I am now currently a student at the University of Washington living in Tacoma WA, earning a Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Software Systems. Scheduled to graduate spring of 2017 and currently looking for internships and or jobs. Please see my resume for further information.
    
    This page is simply my life story and is for people to get a feel for who I am and where I came from. I’ll defiantly be adding to this and re-structuring this page (perhaps with chapters and or sections). My end thought or goal is to almost have an auto biography laid out and put on display here. Feel free to email me with further questions or add in comments (coming soon!)
