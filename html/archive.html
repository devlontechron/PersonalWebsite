    <li>Finally got around to updating and putting content to the main home page. More to come. It still seems dull. </li>
	<li>Updated minor UI things. Made the "Contact" tab a table. Expanded the navigation box. Accent color is now (0,0,255)</li>
	<li>Updated "Projects" tab with job hunt post</li>
	<li>Updated back end of "Projects" for cleaner code and to remove code redundency </li>
	<li>Wasted a lot of time trying to make / figure out a simple and modern image to place inside the nav box.</li>   -->
